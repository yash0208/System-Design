# üìà Analytica ‚Äì Scalable Smart Finance Partner App

**Analytica** is a high-performance, microservices-based financial intelligence platform designed to provide real-time stock market updates, personalized insights, budget tracking, and user behavior analytics. The system is designed with scalability, modularity, and event-driven principles in mind.

---

## üîß System Overview

Analytica processes real-time stock data, user interactions, and financial transactions with a robust backend system powered by:

- Microservices Architecture
- Kafka & Redis for asynchronous messaging
- SQL (for CP) and NoSQL (for AP) databases
- Real-time ML-powered recommendations
- JWT-based authentication
- CDN, Pub/Sub, and message queues

---

## üß± Core Components

### 1. **API Gateway Layer**
- **User Gateway** ‚Äì Handles all user-specific API calls.
- **Budget Gateway** ‚Äì Routes requests related to personal budgets.
- **Market Gateway** ‚Äì Responsible for market news, stocks, and analytics.
- **Load Balancer** ‚Äì Routes traffic regionally with retry/failover logic.

---

### 2. **Authentication & Admin Services**
- Admin & Auth APIs for login/registration.
- JWT tokens for secure sessions.
- Rate limiting, logging, and audit trails.

---

### 3. **News & Market Services**
- News data ingested via APIs, enriched using ML models.
- CDN used for delivering static news content.
- Updates delivered via Redis pub/sub for low-latency pushes.

---

### 4. **Stock Feed & Real-Time Updates**
- Kafka pipelines consume and process stock feed data.
- Feed distributed to subscribed services for pricing, graphs, etc.
- Stock data is cached and sharded by region and symbol.

---

### 5. **User Behavior Tracking**
- Clicks, likes, and interactions tracked and pushed to:
  - NoSQL (AP) ‚Äì for high availability of non-critical analytics.
  - ML pipeline ‚Äì to generate user-tailored insights and recommendations.

---

### 6. **Budgeting & Transaction Service**
- SQL database used for:
  - User balances, transactions, budgeting rules.
  - Ensures ACID guarantees for sensitive data.
- OTP, fraud checks, and audit logs built-in.

---

### 7. **Payment Queue**
- Kafka-based queue for handling payment service asynchronously.
- Retry logic and dead-letter queue support.

---

### 8. **Email Notification Service**
- Message queue used to handle transactional emails without blocking main flow.
- Events like registration, payment success, or budget alerts trigger emails.

---

### 9. **Analytics & ML Layer**
- ML pipeline for:
  - Personalized content.
  - Budget suggestions.
  - Anomaly detection in transactions.
- Trained models served via lightweight APIs.
- Data stored in object storage, indexed for querying.

---

### 10. **Databases**
- **SQL (CP-focused)**: Used for:
  - Core transactions, profiles, budgeting, account state.
- **NoSQL (AP-focused)**: Used for:
  - News feeds, analytics, ML data, user behavior.
- **Sharding Strategy**:
  - Hierarchical sharding based on region, user, and content type.

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements (FR)

These define _what the system should do_ ‚Äî the features and operations it must support.

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization**

- Users should be able to register and log in securely.
    
- JWT-based token management must ensure secure API access.
    
- Role-based access for users and admins.
    

### 2. **Real-Time Stock Data**

- Users should be able to view live stock prices and updates.
    
- The system must fetch and display market data in real time using a pub/sub system.
    

### 3. **News Feed & Insights**

- Users should receive personalized finance news.
    
- News should be filterable by topic, popularity, and relevance.
    
- Support for liking/saving articles and syncing preferences.
    

### 4. **Budget & Transaction Management**

- Users can set and manage personal budgets.
    
- Users can add, update, and delete financial transactions.
    
- Transactions must support categorization and date/time filters.
    

### 5. **Analytics & Reports**

- Users receive monthly/weekly insights about spending and saving.
    
- ML-generated suggestions for saving, investment, and risk warnings.
    

### 6. **Payment Processing**

- Users can connect bank accounts and process payments.
    
- Payments are queued and processed asynchronously with status updates.
    

### 7. **Notification System**

- The system should send emails on key actions: signups, payment success, overspending alerts, etc.
    
- Emails must be sent asynchronously via a message queue.
    

### 8. **Admin Control Panel**

- Admins can view logs, manage users, and moderate news feeds.
    
- Access to service health dashboards and usage metrics.
    

---

## üìê Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

These define _how the system should perform_, focusing on system attributes.

### 1. **Scalability**

- System must scale horizontally across microservices and database shards.
    
- Supports high concurrency (100K+ concurrent users globally).
    

### 2. **Performance**

- Stock and news APIs must return results within 300ms on average.
    
- Real-time feed updates should reflect changes within 1 second.
    

### 3. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**

- Payment and email services must have retry mechanisms and DLQs.
    
- System must remain functional even if one or more services fail (graceful degradation).
    

### 4. **Availability**

- Designed for 99.9% uptime using load balancing and regional failover.
    
- CDN and caching layers for low-latency content delivery.
    

### 5. **Security**

- All communications must be encrypted (HTTPS).
    
- Token-based access control with expiration, refresh, and revocation support.
    
- Logs must be stored securely with restricted admin access.
    

### 6. **Maintainability**

- Microservice separation ensures ease of updates and deployments.
    
- CI/CD pipelines and Dockerized environments.
    

### 7. **Observability**

- Each service must emit logs, metrics, and traces.
    
- Centralized logging and alerting dashboards for monitoring.
    

### 8. **Data Consistency**

- CP (SQL) stores ensure transactional accuracy (e.g., budgets, user accounts).
    
- AP (NoSQL) stores used for news feed and behavioral tracking (eventual consistency accepted).
